3) Select the name/description/background of the room
4) Open the command line (F15 or Ctrl + Shift +K). WARNING: copy-pasting code into the command line can be dangerous, you should only copy-paste code that you can understand and that comes from a trusted source.

6) Copy the content of the BOT .js file that you want to use into the command window and press ENTER.

## CommonBotAssets.js

This file contains some assets useful to create the BOTs.

* Code to autorelog after a disconnetion (thanks to Jessica Lane)
* Code needed to intercept the message in the chat
* Code to understand garbled messages (not actually needed for the bot to understand messages)
* Code to recover the character object (getCharacterObject()) starting from anything: player position in the room (0-9), the player MemberNumber or the character Object
* Code to rapidly free players from all restrains and undress them: removeRestrains(char), removeClothes(char), free(char), freeAll()
	
	char: can be the player position in the room (0-9), the player MemberNumber or the character Object. 

* Code to dress/restrain players into specific clothes: dressLike(char, dress, dressColor)

	dress: can be doll, doll2, talkingDoll, maid, cow , pony, pony elegant, pony race, cat, dog, trainer, trainer sub, mistress.
